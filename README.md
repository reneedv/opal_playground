Experimenting with opal to write CSS, JS, and the DOM with Ruby

I'm currently stuck on the commented out jQuery Document.ready because the Rake build is aborted (it can't find jQuery).

Some References I've worked from:
http://opalrb.org/docs/static_applications/ - This is where I started from.
http://opalrb.org/docs/getting_started/ - This mentions that opal-jquery needs to wrap an instance of jquery, but I'm not sure how to make that work. I considered using the jquery-rails gem, but don't want any rails dependencies yet.
